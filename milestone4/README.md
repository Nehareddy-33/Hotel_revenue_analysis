## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

* **Total Revenue:** 9M
* **Occupancy Rate:** 77.49%
* **Average Daily Rate (ADR):** 14K
* **Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR):** 10.39K

These KPIs provide a snapshot of financial health, demand strength, and revenue efficiency.

## Revenue Trend Analysis

### Revenue by Month

* Revenue shows a decline toward March followed by recovery in later months.
* The dip suggests seasonal softness or demand fluctuations.
* Recovery trend indicates potential effectiveness of pricing or demand recovery.

**Insight:** Revenue volatility highlights the need for dynamic pricing and targeted promotions during low-performing months.

---

## Occupancy Analysis

### Occupancy % by Season

* Seasonal occupancy distribution remains relatively balanced across Spring, Summer, and Winter (~76–78%).
* No extreme seasonal spike is observed, suggesting stable but moderately fluctuating demand.

**Insight:** Since occupancy remains around 77%, pricing optimization becomes critical to increase revenue rather than relying solely on volume growth.

---

## Revenue by Booking Channel

### Direct vs OTA Performance

* Direct and OTA channels both contribute significantly to revenue.
* OTA shows strong revenue share but may involve commission costs.
* Direct channel performance indicates opportunity to improve margin retention.

**Insight:** Increasing direct bookings can improve profitability by reducing third-party commissions.

---

## Revenue by Room Category

* Deluxe category contributes the highest revenue (~5.4M).
* Standard rooms contribute ~3.0M.
* Premium category contributes ~0.9M.

**Insight:** Deluxe rooms are the primary revenue driver, while Premium rooms may present upsell growth opportunities.

---

## Pricing Tier Logic Used

Pricing recommendations are aligned with occupancy and revenue performance:

* **Premium Pricing Tier:** Applied when occupancy exceeds 80% or revenue trend is rising.
* **Standard Pricing Tier:** Applied when occupancy is stable around 70–80%.
* **Promotional Pricing Tier:** Applied during revenue dips (e.g., March) or lower occupancy periods.

This tier-based approach ensures pricing decisions are demand-driven.

---

## Upsell Strategy Identification Approach

Upsell opportunities are derived from:

* High Deluxe room demand
* Stable occupancy above 75%
* Revenue distribution across room categories

### Upsell Recommendations

* Promote Premium upgrades during high occupancy periods.
* Bundle add-ons (meals, spa, experiences) with Deluxe bookings.
* Offer limited-time upgrade incentives during moderate-demand months.

---

## Seasonal Promotion Insights

* Revenue dip periods require short-term promotional campaigns.
* Balanced seasonal occupancy suggests promotions should target specific low-performing months rather than entire seasons.
* Forecast-aligned offers reduce unnecessary discounting during strong demand.

---

## Key Revenue Improvement Recommendations

1. Increase pricing during strong occupancy periods to maximize RevPAR.
2. Strengthen direct booking incentives to improve profit margins.
3. Introduce strategic upsell campaigns for Premium rooms.
4. Apply targeted promotions during revenue dip months.
5. Continuously monitor occupancy and revenue trends for dynamic adjustments.

---

## Business Impact of Proposed Strategies

Implementation of these strategies is expected to:

* Improve RevPAR through optimized pricing.
* Increase average booking value via structured upselling.
* Reduce dependency on OTA channels.
* Stabilize revenue during seasonal fluctuations.
* Enhance overall revenue predictability.

## Conclusion

The Revenue Strategy Dashboard integrates financial KPIs, occupancy patterns, booking channel performance, and room category contributions into a unified revenue optimization framework. By applying structured pricing tiers, data-driven upsell strategies, and targeted seasonal promotions, the organization can maximize profitability while maintaining demand stability.
