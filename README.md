This project focuses on analyzing hotel performance and revenue trends using Power BI Desktop. The dataset represents daily aggregated hotel data, including check-ins, check-outs, ADR, RevPAR, bookings, and cancellations.

The goal of this project is to build a clean star schema model, create meaningful KPIs, and design an interactive dashboard that provides insights into hotel revenue, room categories, seasons, and hotel types (Resort vs City).
